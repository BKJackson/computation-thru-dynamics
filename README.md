## LFADS - Latent Factor Analysis via Dynamics Systems

LFADS is a tool for inferring dynamics from noisy, high-dimensional observations
of a dynamics system.  It is a sequential auto-encoder with some very particular
bells and whistles.  Here we have released a tutorial version, written in
Python/Numpy/JAX intentionally implemented with readabilily, comprehension and
innovation in mind.
